* 使用本地浏览器打开远程服务器上的jupyter notebook
To make the connection faster, you can follow below instructions:

- First, make sure you install Jupyter notebook in both remote 
  (working station in your offcie) and local (your home computer)
- In remote host, open the terminal, change directory to where
  you have your notebooks and type:

#+begin_src python
jupyternotebook--no-browser--port=8889# you should leave the this open
#+END_SRC

- In your local computer, open MS-DOS cmd (if using Windows) or
  Unix terminal, then type:

#+begin_src python
# make sure to change `username` to your real username in remote host
# change `your_remote_host_name` to your address of your working station
# Example: ssh -N -f -L localhost:8888:localhost:8889 guest@192.168.0.132
ssh-N-f-Llocalhost:8888:localhost:8889username@your_remote_host_name
#+END_SRC

- Now open web browser (google chrome, firefox, ...) and type:
  ~localhost:8888~
  you will see your notebooks in your given directory
- If Token needed, go to remote server, type output of this command:

#+begin_src python
jupyter notebook list|tail -n 1|cut -d = -f 2|cut -d ' ' -f 1
#+END_SRC
